<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>
We learn more about an academic institute by keeping track of their students. Due to Covid-19 pandemic our education system totally shifted online. Unfortunately, Most of the Schools in our country does not have a system to keep in touch with their students.
<p>As a result, The teachers and students are almost disconnected from each other, On the other hand it seems due to Covid-19 educational institute will not open soon.</p>
<p>So there is no communication between the teachers and students, To create communication between them we have come up with School Management Portal.</p>
<p>Our mission is to connect all existing Students of a institution no matter where they are in this world with internet connection. Each students can find the latest educational update inside the website.</p>
<p>Student Management Portal is a web application built with the latest technologies, It will builds the connection between the teachers and students.
 </p>

<li>Admin Panel – The admins will have full control over the whole system adding/updating company names and/or updating other information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p>In order to give users a better experience, we have decided to go with latest technologies for developing this application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Frontend</em></p>
<p>For the front end we will be using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. They are lightweight and customizable. Supported by all popular browsers.</p>
<p><em>Backend</em></p>
<p>We will use Python’s web framework - Django as the website’s backend. Django hides website's source code. The framework has protection against XSS and CSRF attacks, SQL injections, clickjacking, etc. Django notifies of a number of common security mistakes better than PHP.</p>
<p>On the other hand we will be using SQLite which is versatile and portable.</p>

<p><em>Payment method</em></p>
<p>We will use Python’s Stripe Library for collecting payments. The Stripe Python library provides convenient access to the Stripe API from applications written in the Python language. This API is designed with python and allows custom ways to take payments – Credit cards, Gift cards etc. We will be using this API to ensure that users can pay using their Visa Cards and MasterCards.</p>
<p><em>Additional technologies</em></p>
<p>Django will be used to allow users to login using their Facebook and/or Google account. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monetization</strong></p>
<p>As the web application is targeting the authority and students of the Schools, we will try to get fund from the school.</p>
<p>Companies can also place ads on the portal for jobs charging 100 BDT per day. We will provide an advertisement package for such companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Social Value</strong></p>
<p>By using this web portals students ,any student can access them from anywhere, they
can contact teachers anytime, ask for help with studies. So eventually there is no need for private tuition.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Alternate Approach</strong></p>
<p>Routing can be a little problematic in Django as there is no built-in structure to develop an API. In this case Laravel makes routing is simple because here we can easily develop API, Laravel also offers notifications alert when there is some errors in templates, where Django offers no notifications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Database</strong></p>
<p>Database is one of the important parts of a software, SQLite can run and be compiled on a variety of systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. Moreover, since a SQLite database is stored in only a single file rather than a collection of separate ones, it is significantly more flexible in terms of its portability.</p>
